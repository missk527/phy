      <details open>
        <summary>Position in the electromagnetic spectrum</summary>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Microwaves</strong> and <strong>infrared (IR)</strong> are the 2nd and 3rd groups in the electromagnetic spectrum (from the long-wavelength end).</li>
          <li>Because they are on the left side of the spectrum, they have <strong>relatively long wavelengths</strong> and <strong>low frequencies</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Microwaves for satellite communication</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Some microwaves are <strong>not absorbed by water molecules</strong>.</li>
          <li>These are used for <strong>satellite communication</strong> because the waves must pass through the <strong>Earth’s atmosphere</strong>, which contains water.</li>
          <li>Microwaves are sent up to a satellite, then the satellite <strong>transmits them back to Earth</strong>.</li>
          <li>We detect the signal using a <strong>satellite dish</strong> (e.g., for satellite TV).</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Microwaves in ovens (heating food)</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Other microwaves are <strong>absorbed by water molecules</strong>.</li>
          <li>In a microwave oven, water molecules absorb microwave energy and <strong>vibrate more</strong>.</li>
          <li>Vibrating water molecules transfer energy to nearby particles so heat spreads through the food by <strong>conduction</strong> and/or <strong>convection</strong>.</li>
          <li>Foods with <strong>more water</strong> usually heat up <strong>faster</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Infrared radiation and temperature</summary>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Infrared radiation</strong> is emitted by all objects that have <strong>thermal (heat) energy</strong>.</li>
          <li>The <strong>hotter</strong> the object, the <strong>more infrared</strong> it emits.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Infrared cameras (thermal imaging)</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Infrared cameras detect IR to show which areas are <strong>hot</strong> and which are <strong>cold</strong>.</li>
          <li>This helps us <strong>see in the dark</strong> and spot living organisms.</li>
          <li>Warm animals appear <strong>bright</strong> because they emit lots of IR; cooler surroundings appear <strong>darker</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Infrared for cooking</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Hot metal in ovens and grills emits lots of infrared radiation, which transfers heat to food and cooks it.</li>
          <li>IR does <strong>not penetrate deeply</strong> into food, so heating is mainly at the surface.</li>
          <li>That’s why bread <strong>toasts</strong> in a toaster instead of warming evenly like in a microwave.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Infrared heaters</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Electric heaters use electrical energy to heat metal elements.</li>
          <li>The hot element emits infrared radiation that warms the surroundings (heats rooms).</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Hazards</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Microwaves and infrared are generally <strong>safe at background levels</strong>.</li>
          <li>They can be harmful in <strong>high quantities</strong> because they transfer large amounts of energy.</li>
          <li>Microwaves can heat living tissue (cells can <strong>boil</strong> and be destroyed).</li>
          <li>Strong infrared from grills/toasters can cause <strong>burns</strong> by damaging skin cells.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Take-home message</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Microwaves can be used for communication (if not absorbed by water) and for heating (if absorbed by water).</li>
          <li>Infrared is emitted by warm objects and is useful for thermal imaging, cooking, and heating rooms.</li>
          <li>Both are mainly harmful only at high intensities due to heating effects.</li>
