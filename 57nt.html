      <h2>Key Notes (English)</h2>
      <p class="muted">Adapted from the provided speech. Focus: the statement of Newton's third law, what “equal and opposite” means, and how it links to acceleration via F = ma.</p>

      <details open>
        <summary>1) Newton’s Third Law – Definition</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Newton’s third law states that when <strong>two objects interact</strong>, the forces they exert on each other are <strong>equal and opposite</strong>.</li>
          <li>This means:
            <ul>
              <li>They are equal in <strong>magnitude</strong> (size).</li>
              <li>They are opposite in <strong>direction</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>This is the definition you can use directly in an exam.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>2) Equal and Opposite – What It Means</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>The <strong>“equal”</strong> part refers to the <strong>size (magnitude)</strong> of the forces.</li>
          <li>The <strong>“opposite”</strong> part refers to their <strong>directions</strong>.</li>
          <li>Example:
            <ul>
              <li>If you push a box with a force of <strong>100 N</strong>,</li>
              <li>the box pushes back on you with a force of <strong>100 N</strong> in the opposite direction.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>3) Normal Contact Force</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>The force that the box exerts on you is called the <strong>normal contact force</strong>.</li>
          <li>It acts at the <strong>point of contact</strong> between two solid objects.</li>
          <li>Normal contact forces are one example of a <strong>Newton’s third law pair</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>4) Which Object Moves?</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Even though the forces are equal and opposite, the motion of the objects can be very different.</li>
          <li>If the box is <strong>small</strong> (low mass), the box is more likely to be the one that <strong>moves</strong>.</li>
          <li>If the box is <strong>very big</strong> (large mass), it might hardly move at all, and <strong>you</strong> might be pushed backwards instead.</li>
          <li>Sometimes both objects move a bit (for example with a <strong>medium-sized</strong> box).</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>5) Everyday Examples</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>When you <strong>push yourself off a wall</strong>:
            <ul>
              <li>You push the wall, and the wall pushes you back with an equal and opposite force.</li>
              <li><strong>You</strong> are the one that moves away from the wall.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>When you <strong>jump off the ground</strong>:
            <ul>
              <li>Your feet push down on the ground.</li>
              <li>The ground pushes you upwards with an equal and opposite force, so you move up.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>In each case, the forces are equal and opposite, but the <strong>effect</strong> (the motion) depends on mass.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>6) Link to Newton’s Second Law</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Newton’s second law is <strong>F = ma</strong>, where:
            <ul>
              <li><code>F</code> is the resultant force (N)</li>
              <li><code>m</code> is the mass (kg)</li>
              <li><code>a</code> is the acceleration (m/s²)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Rearranging gives <strong>a = F / m</strong>.</li>
          <li>This shows that acceleration depends on the <strong>force</strong> and the <strong>mass</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>7) Why Smaller Objects Move More</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>For two objects pushing on each other, the forces are equal (same F).</li>
          <li>However, their masses can be different.</li>
          <li>From <strong>a = F / m</strong>:
            <ul>
              <li>If <strong>m is small</strong>, then <strong>a</strong> is larger.</li>
              <li>If <strong>m is large</strong>, then <strong>a</strong> is smaller.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>So the object with the <strong>smaller mass</strong> will generally have the <strong>larger acceleration</strong> and move more.</li>
          <li>This explains why a light box moves more easily than a heavy box when you push.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>8) Not “One Force Only” – Always Pairs</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Newton’s third law always involves a <strong>pair of forces</strong> on <strong>two different objects</strong>.</li>
          <li>It is wrong to think “you push the box, but the box does nothing”.</li>
          <li>The box <strong>always</strong> pushes back on you with an equal and opposite force.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>9) Motion vs Force – Key Idea</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Equal and opposite forces <strong>do not automatically mean</strong> equal motion.</li>
          <li>Motion depends on <strong>both</strong> the force and the mass (via <strong>F = ma</strong>).</li>
          <li>Therefore:
            <ul>
              <li>A light object can accelerate a lot.</li>
              <li>A heavy object may accelerate very little, even with the same force.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>10) Key Takeaways</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Newton’s third law: when two objects interact, they exert <strong>equal and opposite forces</strong> on each other.</li>
          <li>Equal = same magnitude; opposite = opposite direction.</li>
          <li>Examples include pushing a box, pushing off a wall, or jumping off the ground.</li>
          <li>Which object moves more depends on <strong>mass</strong>, using <strong>F = ma</strong> and <strong>a = F / m</strong>.</li>
          <li>The <strong>smaller mass</strong> generally gets the <strong>larger acceleration</strong> and moves most.</li>
        </ul>
