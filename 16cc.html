      <h2>Key Notes (rewritten from the speech)</h2>

      <details open>
        <summary>1) What is electric charge?</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>This video introduces <b>electric charge</b> and the main equation used to calculate it.</li>
          <li>Charge is a measure of the <b>total current</b> that has flowed during a certain <b>time</b>.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="chem">
Definition of charge
• Charge (Q) measures how much electric charge has passed a point
  in a circuit over a certain time.
• It depends on:
  - how big the current is
  - how long the current flows
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>A water analogy can help:
            <ul>
              <li>Current is like the <b>rate</b> at which water flows down a river.</li>
              <li>Charge is like the <b>total amount of water</b> that has flowed past in a minute or an hour.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>2) Symbols and units</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Charge is represented by the letter <b>Q</b>.</li>
          <li>The unit of charge is the <b>coulomb</b>, written as <b>C</b>.</li>
          <li>Current is represented by <b>I</b> and is measured in <b>amperes (amps, A)</b>.</li>
          <li>Time is represented by <b>t</b> and is measured in <b>seconds (s)</b>.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="chem">
Key symbols
• Q = charge, in coulombs (C)
• I = current, in amperes (A)
• t = time, in seconds (s)
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>3) The charge equation: Q = I × t</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>The equation to remember is:
        </ul>
        <div class="chem">
Charge equation
Q = I × t

Q = charge (C)
I = current (A)
t = time (s)
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>This means: the total charge is equal to the <b>current</b> multiplied by the <b>time</b>.</li>
          <li>If the current is bigger, or the current flows for longer, then <b>more charge</b> passes through the circuit.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>4) Example 1: kettle question</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Example: A kettle draws a current of <b>12 A</b> and takes <b>50 s</b> to boil.</li>
          <li>Question: How much charge passed through the wire?</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="chem">
Given:
• I = 12 A
• t = 50 s

Using Q = I × t:
Q = 12 × 50 = 600 C

So 600 coulombs of charge pass through the wire.
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>In this example the current is already in amps and the time is already in seconds, so we can use the equation directly.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>5) Rearranging the formula to find current</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Sometimes we know the <b>total charge</b> and the <b>time</b>, and we need to find the <b>current</b>.</li>
          <li>Starting from Q = I × t, we can rearrange the formula by dividing both sides by t.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="chem">
Rearranged for current
Q = I × t  →  I = Q / t

• To find I, divide the total charge by the time.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>6) Example 2: phone charger question</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Example: A phone charger transfers a total charge of <b>43.2 kC</b> over a period of <b>2 hours</b>.</li>
          <li>Question: What current flowed through the wire?</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="chem">
Step 1 – Use I = Q / t

Step 2 – Convert units
• Charge: 43.2 kC = 43,200 C
• Time: 2 hours
  - 2 × 60 = 120 minutes
  - 120 × 60 = 7,200 seconds

Step 3 – Calculate current
I = Q / t = 43,200 C / 7,200 s = 6 A

So the current through the charger is 6 A.
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>Always make sure charge is in <b>coulombs</b> and time is in <b>seconds</b> before using the formula.</li>
        </ul>
