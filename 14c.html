      <h2>Key Notes (rewritten from the speech)</h2>

      <details open>
        <summary>1) What is an electric circuit?</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>An <b>electric circuit</b> is a <b>closed loop</b> that allows charge (electrons) to flow.</li>
          <li>It must include a <b>power source</b> (e.g. cell or battery) and a <b>conducting path</b> (wires).</li>
          <li>The simplest circuit is: <b>cell + wires + component</b> (e.g. a lamp) all connected in a loop.</li>
          <li>We usually represent circuits using <b>circuit diagrams</b> with standard symbols.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>2) Basic circuit symbols</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>A <b>cell</b> is a single power source. Its symbol has a long line (positive) and a short line (negative).</li>
          <li>A <b>battery</b> is two or more cells joined together. Its symbol is just several cell symbols in a row.</li>
          <li>In exams, cells and batteries behave in the <b>same way</b> – they both provide potential difference.</li>
        </ul>
        <div>
          <span class="pill">Cell</span>
          <span class="pill">Battery (two or more cells)</span>
          <span class="pill">Filament lamp (light bulb)</span>
          <span class="pill">Switch (open / closed)</span>
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>A <b>filament lamp</b> is a small light bulb; if the circuit is complete and powered, it lights up.</li>
          <li>A <b>switch</b> can be:
            <ul>
              <li><b>Closed</b> – circuit complete, current can flow, lamp is on.</li>
              <li><b>Open</b> – circuit broken, current stops, lamp is off.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>3) Electric current (I)</summary>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Current</b> is the <b>rate of flow of charge</b> (the flow of electrons) around a circuit.</li>
          <li>It is denoted by the letter <b>I</b>.</li>
          <li>It is measured in <b>amperes</b> (amps), symbol <b>A</b>.</li>
          <li>You can think of current like the <b>flow of water</b> through a pipe.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="chem">
Current (I)
• Measures how much charge passes a point each second.
• Unit: ampere (A).
• Analogy: water flow in a pipe.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>4) Potential difference / voltage (V)</summary>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Potential difference</b> (p.d.) is the <b>driving force</b> that pushes electrons around the circuit.</li>
          <li>It is provided by the <b>cell</b> or <b>battery</b>.</li>
          <li>It is denoted by the letter <b>V</b>.</li>
          <li>Another common name for potential difference is <b>voltage</b>.</li>
          <li>It is measured in <b>volts</b>, symbol <b>V</b>.</li>
          <li>Analogy: it is like the <b>pump</b> that pushes water along a pipe.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="chem">
Potential difference (V)
• "Push" provided by the power source.
• Unit: volt (V).
• Also called voltage.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>5) Resistance (R)</summary>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Resistance</b> is anything that <b>opposes</b> or <b>resists</b> the flow of electrons.</li>
          <li>It is denoted by the letter <b>R</b>.</li>
          <li>It is measured in <b>ohms</b>, symbol <b>Ω</b>.</li>
          <li>Analogy: resistance is like a <b>partial blockage</b> in a water pipe, making it harder for water to flow.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="chem">
Resistance (R)
• Opposes current in a circuit.
• Unit: ohm (Ω).
• Analogy: a blockage in a pipe.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>6) Direction of electron flow vs conventional current</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>In a cell symbol, the <b>longer line</b> is the <b>positive terminal</b>.</li>
          <li>The <b>shorter line</b> is the <b>negative terminal</b>.</li>
          <li>Electrons are <b>negatively charged</b>, so they actually flow from the <b>negative</b> terminal to the <b>positive</b> terminal.</li>
          <li>Historically, people did not know about electrons, so they said current flows from <b>positive to negative</b>.</li>
          <li>This is called <b>conventional current</b>, and we still use this definition in circuits and exams.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="chem">
Electron flow: negative → positive
Conventional current: positive → negative
(For exams, always use conventional current direction.)
