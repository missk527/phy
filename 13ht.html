      <h2>Key Notes (English)</h2>
      <p class="muted">Adapted from the provided speech. Focus: how hydroelectric dams and tidal barrages generate electricity, and their advantages and disadvantages.</p>

      <details open>
        <summary>1) Basic Idea of Both Systems</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Both <strong>hydroelectric dams</strong> and <strong>tidal barrages</strong> work in basically the same way.</li>
          <li>They use a <strong>dam</strong> to stop water flowing normally, creating a <strong>higher water level</strong> on one side than the other.</li>
          <li>This difference in height means the stored water has a lot of <strong>gravitational potential energy</strong>.</li>
          <li>That energy can be converted into <strong>electrical energy</strong> using turbines and generators.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>2) Hydroelectric Dams</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>In a normal hydroelectric dam, water from the river <strong>upstream</strong> is trapped by the dam.</li>
          <li>This stops the water from continuing its journey to the ocean.</li>
          <li>Over time, a huge volume of water builds up behind the dam, forming a <strong>reservoir</strong> (like an artificial lake).</li>
          <li>The water level in the reservoir is much <strong>higher</strong> than the water level downstream.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>3) Tidal Barrages</summary>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Tides</strong> are the regular rise and fall of sea levels, mainly caused by the <strong>gravitational pull of the Moon</strong>.</li>
          <li>We usually get <strong>two high tides</strong> each day, when the sea level rises.</li>
          <li>Tides affect not only the open ocean but also <strong>estuaries</strong>, where rivers meet the sea.</li>
          <li>A <strong>tidal barrage</strong> is basically a big dam built across an estuary.</li>
          <li>As the tide comes in, water is trapped behind the barrage.</li>
          <li>When the tide goes out again, a large difference in water level remains on the two sides of the barrage.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>4) Converting Gravitational Energy to Electrical Energy</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>The <strong>height difference</strong> between the water levels gives the stored water a lot of gravitational potential energy.</li>
          <li>When water is released from the reservoir (or behind a barrage), it flows downwards through the dam.</li>
          <li>The <strong>force of the moving water</strong> spins the blades of <strong>turbines</strong> inside the dam.</li>
          <li>These turbines are connected to <strong>generators</strong>, which produce electrical power as they spin.</li>
          <li>After passing through the turbines, the water flows out into the river or sea on the other side.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>5) Similarities Between Hydroelectric Dams and Tidal Barrages</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Both use a <strong>dam structure</strong> to create a difference in water level.</li>
          <li>Both rely on <strong>gravitational potential energy</strong> of stored water.</li>
          <li>Both use <strong>turbines and generators</strong> to convert energy of moving water into electricity.</li>
          <li>Both can generate <strong>large amounts of electrical power</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>6) Main Advantages</summary>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="pill">No pollution while running</span> They generate electricity with <strong>no direct air pollution</strong> (no greenhouse gases during operation).</li>
          <li><span class="pill">Reliable</span> Both methods are <strong>reliable sources of electricity</strong>.</li>
          <li><span class="pill">Quick response (hydroelectric)</span> Hydroelectric dams in particular can provide an <strong>immediate response</strong> to an increase in electricity demand.</li>
          <li><span class="pill">Low running costs</span> Once built, the <strong>running costs</strong> are fairly low.</li>
          <li><span class="pill">Flexible scale</span> They can be built on both <strong>large and small scales</strong> (big power stations or small local schemes).</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>7) Main Disadvantages – Environmental Impact</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>The main disadvantage is the <strong>impact on the environment</strong>.</li>
          <li><span class="pill">Flooding</span> Hydroelectric dams often flood very large areas.</li>
          <li>This can <strong>submerge habitats</strong> such as forests, wetlands and farmland.</li>
          <li>Sometimes entire <strong>villages</strong> are flooded and people have to move.</li>
          <li><span class="pill">Blocking movement</span> Both dams and barrages can stop <strong>boats</strong> and <strong>fish</strong> from traveling up or down the river.</li>
          <li>This can damage <strong>fish migration routes</strong> and river ecosystems.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>8) Main Disadvantages – Cost</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>The <strong>initial setup cost</strong> of building a dam or tidal barrage is usually very <strong>high</strong>.</li>
          <li>They require large construction projects, lots of materials and careful design.</li>
          <li>However, once built, the <strong>running costs</strong> are relatively low compared with fossil fuel power stations.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>9) Summary of Hydroelectric Dams</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Use a <strong>river dam</strong> to create a high reservoir of water.</li>
          <li>Convert gravitational potential energy of stored water into electricity via turbines and generators.</li>
          <li><strong>Pros:</strong> no pollution while running, reliable, very quick response to demand, low running costs.</li>
          <li><strong>Cons:</strong> can flood huge areas, destroy habitats, displace people, and block fish and boats; expensive to build.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>10) Summary of Tidal Barrages</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Use <strong>tides</strong> (rise and fall of sea level) in <strong>estuaries</strong>.</li>
          <li>Trap water at <strong>high tide</strong> behind a barrage and release it as the tide falls.</li>
          <li>Like hydroelectric dams, they use turbines and generators.</li>
          <li><strong>Pros:</strong> renewable, no pollution while running, reliable pattern of tides, low running costs.</li>
          <li><strong>Cons:</strong> environmental changes in estuaries, effects on marine life and navigation, high construction cost.</li>
        </ul>
