      <h2>Key Notes (rewritten from the speech)</h2>

      <details open>
        <summary>1) What is stopping distance?</summary>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Stopping distance</b> is the <b>minimum distance</b> a vehicle needs to <b>stop in an emergency</b>.</li>
          <li>Total stopping distance has two parts:
            <div class="chem">
Total stopping distance = Thinking distance + Braking distance
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>In exams, you must clearly distinguish between:
            <ul>
              <li><b>Thinking distance</b> – before the brakes are applied.</li>
              <li><b>Braking distance</b> – after the brakes are applied.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>2) Thinking distance &amp; reaction time</summary>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Thinking distance</b> is how far the vehicle travels during the <b>driver’s reaction time</b>.</li>
          <li><b>Reaction time</b> is the time between:
            <ul>
              <li>the driver seeing a hazard and</li>
              <li>the driver actually pressing the brake pedal.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="chem">
Thinking distance depends on:
• Speed of the vehicle
• Driver’s reaction time

If speed ↑ or reaction time ↑ → thinking distance ↑
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>Reaction time varies from person to person.</li>
          <li>Anything that <b>reduces alertness</b> tends to <b>increase reaction time</b>, for example:
            <div>
              <span class="pill">Tiredness</span>
              <span class="pill">Alcohol (drunk)</span>
              <span class="pill">Drugs</span>
              <span class="pill">Distractions (e.g. using a phone)</span>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>If reaction time increases, <b>thinking distance increases</b>.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>3) Braking distance &amp; key factors</summary>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Braking distance</b> is the distance the car travels <b>after the brakes are applied</b> until it <b>comes to a stop</b>.</li>
          <li>It is the distance covered under the <b>braking force</b> (under normal conditions).</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="chem">
Main factors affecting braking distance:
1. Speed of the vehicle
2. Mass of the vehicle
3. Condition of the brakes
4. Condition of the tyres and road surface
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Speed and mass</b>:
            <ul>
              <li>Both affect the vehicle’s <b>kinetic energy</b>.</li>
              <li>The more kinetic energy the vehicle has, the more energy must be removed to stop it.</li>
              <li>Higher speed or greater mass → <b>longer braking distance</b>.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><b>Condition of the brakes</b>:
            <ul>
              <li>Worn or faulty brakes cannot apply as much force.</li>
              <li>The car slows down more slowly and travels further before stopping.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><b>Traction between tyres and road</b>:
            <ul>
              <li>If the road is <b>wet or icy</b>, there is <b>less friction</b>.</li>
              <li>Low friction can cause the car to <b>skid</b>.</li>
              <li><b>Bald tyres</b> (no tread) cannot grip the road well.</li>
              <li>Poor tyre condition also increases braking distance.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>4) Effect of speed on stopping distance</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>We can show stopping distance using diagrams:
            <ul>
              <li>Each car has a <b>purple</b> section = thinking distance.</li>
              <li>Each car has a <b>red</b> section = braking distance.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Thinking distance:
            <ul>
              <li>Increases <b>proportionally</b> with speed.</li>
              <li>If speed doubles, thinking distance also roughly <b>doubles</b>.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Braking distance:
            <ul>
              <li>Increases <b>more quickly</b> than thinking distance.</li>
              <li>If you <b>double</b> the speed, braking distance becomes about <b>four times</b> larger.</li>
              <li>If you <b>triple</b> the speed, braking distance becomes about <b>nine times</b> larger.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="chem">
Braking distance ∝ speed²  (it increases with the square of speed)

Double speed → braking distance × 4
Triple speed → braking distance × 9
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>As a result, a graph of <b>total stopping distance vs speed</b> is <b>curved</b>, not a straight line.</li>
          <li>The graph gets <b>steeper</b> as speed increases.</li>
          <li><b>Key message:</b> If you are travelling fast, it will take <b>much longer</b> to stop than you might expect.</li>
        </ul>
