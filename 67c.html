      <h2>Key Notes (rewritten from the speech)</h2>
<details open>
  <summary>1) Visible light basics</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>Visible light is the part of the electromagnetic spectrum that <strong>our eyes detect</strong>.</li>
    <li>Different colours are different <strong>wavelengths</strong>: <strong>red</strong> has the <strong>longest</strong> wavelength and <strong>violet</strong> the <strong>shortest</strong>.</li>
    <li>Use <strong>ROY G BIV</strong> to remember the order: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet.</li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>2) Using visible light for communication</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>Visible (or near-visible) light can carry information through <strong>optical fibres</strong> (thin glass/plastic strands).</li>
    <li>Data is sent as <strong>pulses of light</strong> that are <strong>encoded</strong> to represent information.</li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>3) How optical fibres guide light</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>Light stays inside the fibre because it is <strong>reflected at the boundary</strong> again and again, so it “bounces” along the fibre to the other end.</li>
    <li>To work well, the material must <strong>reflect</strong> the light rather than <strong>absorb</strong> it.</li>
    <li>The reflections should be <strong>specular</strong> (mirror-like), not <strong>diffuse</strong>, so the light is not scattered.</li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>4) Optical fibres vs copper wires</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>Compared with sending signals through <strong>copper wires</strong>, optical fibres can transmit <strong>more information</strong>.</li>
    <li>Fibre signals are also <strong>less likely to be distorted</strong> during transmission.</li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>5) Ultraviolet (UV) radiation</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>Ultraviolet radiation comes <strong>after violet</strong> on the spectrum and has a <strong>shorter wavelength</strong> than visible light.</li>
    <li>Sunlight contains UV: it can cause <strong>suntan</strong> and sometimes <strong>sunburn</strong>.</li>
    <li>We can also produce UV using lamps (e.g., sunbeds).</li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>6) Fluorescence and fluorescent lamps</summary>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Fluorescence</strong> happens when a chemical <strong>absorbs UV</strong> and then <strong>re-emits</strong> the energy as <strong>visible light</strong>.</li>
    <li>That’s why <strong>fluorescent paints</strong> look extremely bright: they are <strong>emitting</strong> light, not just reflecting it.</li>
    <li>In a <strong>fluorescent bulb</strong>, UV is produced first; a <strong>phosphor coating</strong> inside the glass absorbs the UV and re-emits it as visible light.</li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>7) Benefits and other uses of UV</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>Fluorescent bulbs are <strong>energy efficient</strong>, reducing <strong>electricity bills</strong> and <strong>carbon dioxide emissions</strong>.</li>
    <li>UV is used in <strong>security marking</strong>: inks can be invisible in normal light but show up under UV (e.g., banknotes and passports).</li>
    <li>UV can <strong>sterilise water</strong> by destroying microorganisms.</li>
  </ul>
