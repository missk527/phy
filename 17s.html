      <h2>Key Notes (rewritten from the speech)</h2>

      <details open>
        <summary>1) Series vs parallel circuits</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>A key exam confusion is the difference between <b>series</b> and <b>parallel</b> circuits.</li>
          <li>In a <b>series circuit</b>, there is <b>only one loop</b> and all components are connected one after another in that loop.</li>
          <li>In a <b>parallel circuit</b>, there is <b>more than one loop</b> or branch.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="chem">
Series circuit
• Single loop
• Components in a line, one after another

Parallel circuit
• More than one loop (branches)
• Components on different branches
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>This small structural difference changes how we measure and think about:
            <div>
              <span class="pill">Current</span>
              <span class="pill">Voltage (potential difference)</span>
              <span class="pill">Resistance</span>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>This video focuses on <b>series circuits</b>. Parallel circuits are considered in the next video.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>2) Features and disadvantages of series circuits</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>In a series circuit, <b>all components share the same loop</b>.</li>
          <li>If <b>any one component is disconnected or broken</b>, the <b>entire circuit stops working</b>.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="chem">
Key disadvantage of series circuits
• One component fails → current stops everywhere → whole circuit off
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>Because of this major disadvantage, <b>very few practical devices</b> are actually connected in series.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>3) Voltage (potential difference) in series circuits</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>The <b>potential difference</b> (voltage) of the cell or battery is <b>shared</b> across all components in series.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="chem">
Total voltage in series
V<sub>total</sub> = V<sub>1</sub> + V<sub>2</sub> + V<sub>3</sub> + ...
• The sum of the voltages across each component equals the battery voltage.
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>Example: if the battery has <b>12 V</b> and there are only two lamps in series:</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="chem">
Example 1
• Total battery voltage = 12 V
• Lamp A has 8 V across it
• Lamp B must have 4 V
Because 8 V + 4 V = 12 V
        </div>
        <div class="chem">
Example 2 (identical lamps)
• Total battery voltage = 12 V
• Two identical lamps with same resistance
• Each lamp gets 6 V
Because they share the voltage equally
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>4) Current in series circuits</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>In a series circuit, the <b>current is the same everywhere</b> in the loop.</li>
          <li>No matter where you measure it in the series circuit, the value of current is identical.</li>
          <li>Current is measured using an <b>ammeter</b>.</li>
          <li>An ammeter is placed <b>in series</b>, that is, in the main loop with the other components.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="chem">
Current in series
• Same at every point in the loop
• Same through every component
• Measured with an ammeter in series
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>Because the current through all components is the same, it <b>does not matter where in the loop</b> you place the ammeter.</li>
          <li>We can also calculate current using <b>Ohm's law</b> by dividing the total voltage by the total resistance.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="chem">
Ohm's law (rearranged)
I = V<sub>total</sub> / R<sub>total</sub>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>5) Resistance in series and example calculation</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>In a series circuit, the <b>total resistance</b> is the <b>sum</b> of the individual resistances.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="chem">
Total resistance in series
R<sub>total</sub> = R<sub>1</sub> + R<sub>2</sub> + R<sub>3</sub> + ...
(ΣR means "sum of all resistances")
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>Example: a 4 Ω lamp in series with a 2 Ω lamp:</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="chem">
Example: total resistance and current
• R<sub>1</sub> = 4 Ω
• R<sub>2</sub> = 2 Ω
• R<sub>total</sub> = 4 Ω + 2 Ω = 6 Ω

Battery voltage = 12 V
Using I = V / R:
I = 12 V / 6 Ω = 2 A
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>Ammeters usually have <b>very small resistance</b>, so we normally <b>ignore their resistance</b> in calculations.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>6) Voltage across a single component</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Once we know the <b>current in the circuit</b>, we can find the voltage across a <b>single component</b> using Ohm's law.</li>
          <li>Remember: in a series circuit, <b>the current through each component is the same</b>.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="chem">
Finding voltage across one component
V = I × R
• Use the circuit current and that component's resistance
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>Using the previous example with 2 A of current:</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="chem">
Example: voltage across each lamp
• Lamp on the right: R = 2 Ω, I = 2 A
  V = I × R = 2 A × 2 Ω = 4 V

• Total battery voltage = 12 V
  So the other lamp must have 12 V − 4 V = 8 V
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>Another way to find the voltage is to use a <b>voltmeter</b>.</li>
          <li>A voltmeter is connected <b>in parallel</b> across the component we are interested in.</li>
          <li>Even though the voltmeter is in parallel, we still treat the <b>main circuit itself as a series circuit</b>.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="chem">
Important idea
• Components with a greater resistance always get a greater share of the total voltage.
• More resistance means more "push" is needed to move charge through that part of the circuit.
• This is why the 4 Ω lamp had 8 V, while the 2 Ω lamp only had 4 V.
