      <h2>Key Notes (rewritten from the speech)</h2>
<details open>
  <summary>1) What static electricity is</summary>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Static electricity</strong> is a build-up of electric charge on an <strong>insulator</strong>.</li>
    <li>When the charge is released (discharged), it can cause a <strong>spark</strong>.</li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>2) Why most objects are neutral</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>All materials contain <strong>positive protons</strong> and <strong>negative electrons</strong>.</li>
    <li>In a neutral object, total positive charge equals total negative charge, so the overall charge is <strong>zero</strong>.</li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>3) Charging by friction (rubbing)</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>Rubbing two materials creates <strong>friction</strong> that can transfer <strong>electrons</strong> from one material to the other.</li>
    <li><strong>Only electrons move</strong>: protons stay fixed in the nucleus.</li>
    <li>If an object <strong>gains electrons</strong>, it becomes <strong>negatively charged</strong>. If it <strong>loses electrons</strong>, it becomes <strong>positively charged</strong>.</li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>4) Conductors vs insulators</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>In <strong>conductors</strong> (e.g., metals), electrons can move freely, so charge usually flows away and doesn’t build up easily.</li>
    <li>In <strong>insulators</strong> (e.g., plastic rods, cloth), electrons cannot move freely, so charge can stay on the surface and <strong>build up</strong>.</li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>5) Examples of electron transfer</summary>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Polythene rod + cloth:</strong> electrons move onto the polythene → polythene becomes <strong>negative</strong>, cloth becomes <strong>positive</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Acetate rod + cloth:</strong> electrons move off the acetate → acetate becomes <strong>positive</strong>, cloth becomes <strong>negative</strong>.</li>
    <li>Which way electrons transfer depends on the materials involved.</li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>6) Sparks and earthing</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>As charge builds up, a <strong>potential difference</strong> can form between the charged object and the <strong>Earth</strong> (or an earthed object).</li>
    <li>Earth is treated as <strong>0 V</strong>.</li>
    <li>If the potential difference is big enough, electrons can <strong>jump the gap</strong> to discharge — this is a <strong>spark</strong>.</li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>7) Charge build-up on conductors (car example)</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>Charge can sometimes build up on conductors (less common), e.g., a car’s metal frame can gain charge through contact with moving air.</li>
    <li>Touching the car can let it discharge through you to Earth, causing a small <strong>electric shock</strong> (a tiny spark).</li>
  </ul>
