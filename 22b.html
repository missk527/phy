      <h2>Notes (Key points rewritten from the speech)</h2>

      <details open>
        <summary>What are nanoparticles?</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Nanoparticles are <strong>extremely tiny particles</strong> with a diameter of about <strong>1–100 nanometres (nm)</strong>.</li>
          <li>They are far too small to be seen with a <strong>light microscope</strong>.</li>
          <li>The science that studies them is called <strong>nanoscience</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Why do nanoparticles behave differently?</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>A key feature is their very large <strong>surface area to volume ratio</strong>.</li>
          <li>As objects get smaller, <strong>volume decreases faster than surface area</strong>, so the ratio increases.</li>
          <li>Many applications depend on <strong>exposed surface area</strong>, not on bulk volume.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Use 1: Catalysts</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Nanoparticles can act as <strong>catalysts</strong> to speed up chemical reactions.</li>
          <li>Only the <strong>surface</strong> is involved, so nanoparticles can be effective using <strong>much less material</strong> than larger particles.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Use 2: Nanomedicine</summary>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Nanomedicine</strong> uses nanoparticles in medical treatments.</li>
          <li>Scientists are researching <strong>fullerenes</strong> (spheres made of carbon atoms) to <strong>carry drugs</strong> around the body.</li>
          <li>Because they are so small, the aim is to deliver drugs <strong>directly into cells</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Use 3: Electronics</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Some nanoparticles can <strong>conduct electricity</strong>.</li>
          <li>This could allow <strong>very tiny electrical circuits</strong> and potentially <strong>smaller computer chips</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Use 4: Antibacterial materials</summary>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Silver nanoparticles</strong> have <strong>antibacterial</strong> properties.</li>
          <li>They can be used in items like <strong>surgical masks</strong> and <strong>wound dressings</strong> to help <strong>kill bacteria</strong> and reduce infection risk.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Risks and uncertainties</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Nanotechnology is still <strong>relatively new</strong>, so long‑term effects on the body are <strong>not fully understood</strong>.</li>
          <li>There is <strong>no clear evidence</strong> that nanoparticles cause harm, but more testing is needed before we can be confident.</li>
          <li>Some people argue for <strong>stricter regulation</strong> and clearer <strong>labelling</strong> of products that may contain nanoparticles.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Example: Nanoparticles in sunscreen</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Nanoparticles in sunscreen can improve protection because they can give <strong>better skin coverage</strong> against <strong>UV rays</strong>.</li>
          <li>However, it is uncertain whether nanoparticles can <strong>enter the body</strong> and, if they do, whether they could <strong>damage cells</strong>.</li>
          <li>It is also unclear what happens when they are washed into the <strong>sea</strong> and whether they could harm the <strong>environment</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Take‑home message</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Nanoparticles offer many <strong>useful applications</strong> because of their unique size‑dependent properties.</li>
          <li>At the same time, we need <strong>more evidence</strong> about health and environmental impacts to use them safely.</li>
        </ul>
