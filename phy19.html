<h1>Physics – Electrical Circuits and Components</h1>

<ol>
  <li>Circuit symbols are used to represent components clearly and consistently.</li>
  <li>A circuit diagram shows what each component does and the symbol for it.</li>
  <li>A power source can be a cell or a battery.</li>
  <li>A battery is made of multiple cells.</li>
  <li>A switch controls whether current can flow (on or off).</li>
  <li>When a switch is closed, the circuit is complete and current flows.</li>
  <li>When a switch is open, the circuit is broken and current stops.</li>
  <li>This happens because the circuit is no longer complete.</li>
  <li>A lamp is represented by a small bulb symbol.</li>
  <li>A fuse melts and breaks the circuit when too much current flows.</li>
  <li>Fuses prevent damage by stopping excessive current.</li>
  <li>A diode allows current to flow in one direction only.</li>
  <li>This direction is one-way.</li>
  <li>LED stands for Light Emitting Diode.</li>
  <li>An LED lights up when current flows in the forward direction.</li>
  <li>LEDs are used in alarm clocks, traffic lights, and LED bulbs.</li>
  <li>Current is measured using an ammeter.</li>
  <li>An ammeter is connected in series.</li>
  <li>Potential difference (voltage) is measured using a voltmeter.</li>
  <li>A voltmeter is connected in parallel.</li>
  <li>Resistance is measured in ohms (Ω).</li>
  <li>A resistor limits or reduces current by adding resistance.</li>
  <li>A fixed resistor has a set resistance value.</li>
  <li>A variable resistor allows resistance to be adjusted easily.</li>
  <li>LDR stands for Light Dependent Resistor.</li>
  <li>The resistance of an LDR depends on light intensity.</li>
  <li>In bright light, the resistance of an LDR is low.</li>
  <li>In the dark, the resistance of an LDR is high.</li>
  <li>LDRs are used in automatic night lights and burglar alarms.</li>
  <li>Light reduces resistance, allowing more current to power the alarm.</li>
  <li>A thermistor is a temperature-dependent resistor.</li>
  <li>The resistance of a thermistor depends on temperature.</li>
  <li>As temperature increases, resistance falls.</li>
  <li>As temperature decreases, resistance rises.</li>
  <li>Thermistors are used in car engines and electronic thermostats.</li>
  <li>They are used to sense and monitor engine temperature.</li>
  <li>They also sense temperature for control and regulation.</li>
  <li>An ammeter measures current.</li>
  <li>A voltmeter measures potential difference.</li>
  <li>LDRs and thermistors are examples of sensors.</li>
