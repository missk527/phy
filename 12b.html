      <h2>Notes (Key points rewritten from the speech)</h2>

      <details open>
        <summary>What are biofuels?</summary>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Biofuels</strong> are fuels made from <strong>recently living organisms</strong> (e.g., plants, algae; sometimes animal waste).</li>
          <li>They differ from <strong>fossil fuels</strong>, which also came from life but lived <strong>millions of years ago</strong> and formed by different processes.</li>
          <li>Plants and algae use <strong>photosynthesis</strong> to lock up the sun’s energy; burning the fuel releases that stored energy.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details open>
        <summary>Common sources & uses</summary>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Plants and algae</strong> are the main sources; <strong>animal waste</strong> can be used but usually on a smaller scale.</li>
          <li>Biofuels are <strong>easy to transport</strong> and can be <strong>blended with petrol/diesel</strong>, so most drivers don’t need new cars.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details open>
        <summary>Why biofuels are attractive</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Often treated as <strong>carbon neutral</strong>: CO₂ released on burning ≈ CO₂ taken up during growth.</li>
          <li><strong>Renewable</strong> — can be grown repeatedly.</li>
          <li>Typically <strong>relatively cheap</strong> to make compared with some alternatives.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details open>
        <summary>Limitations & real‑world complications</summary>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Land‑use change</strong>: converting natural land (e.g., cutting forests) to grow biofuel crops can damage ecosystems and release large amounts of CO₂ <em>before the first harvest</em>.</li>
          <li><strong>Lifecycle emissions</strong>: harvesting, processing, and transporting biofuels require energy → often more CO₂ is emitted.</li>
          <li><strong>Bottom line</strong>: biofuels are <em>not as perfect</em> as once hoped, but <strong>can be a useful substitute for fossil fuels</strong> when applied appropriately.</li>
          <li>As with all renewables, it’s <strong>not all‑or‑nothing</strong>: use biofuels where they make sense; use other options elsewhere.</li>
        </ul>
