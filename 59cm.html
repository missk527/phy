      <h2>Key Notes (English)</h2>
      <p class="muted">Adapted from the provided speech. Focus: definition of momentum, vector nature, conservation of momentum, collision examples, and recoil problems like the gun–bullet example.</p>

      <details open>
        <summary>1) What Is Momentum?</summary>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Momentum</strong> is a property that all <strong>moving objects</strong> have.</li>
          <li>It depends on both the <strong>mass</strong> of the object and its <strong>velocity</strong>.</li>
          <li>The basic equation is <strong>momentum = mass × velocity</strong>.</li>
          <li>In symbols: <strong>p = m × v</strong>, where p is momentum, m is mass, and v is velocity.</li>
          <li>The SI unit for momentum is <strong>kg m/s</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>2) Example: Dinosaur and Car</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Example 1: A <strong>4500 kg dinosaur</strong) moving at <strong>12 m/s</strong>.</li>
          <li>Its momentum is p = 4500 × 12 = <strong>54,000 kg m/s</strong>.</li>
          <li>Example 2: A <strong>1200 kg car</strong> moving at <strong>25 m/s</strong>.</li>
          <li>Its momentum is p = 1200 × 25 = <strong>30,000 kg m/s</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>3) Momentum Is a Vector Quantity</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Momentum is a <strong>vector</strong>, which means it has both <strong>magnitude and direction</strong>.</li>
          <li>We usually choose one direction (for example, to the right) as <strong>positive</strong>.</li>
          <li>Objects moving in the opposite direction then have <strong>negative momentum</strong>.</li>
          <li>In the example, if we take right as positive, the dinosaur moving right has <strong>positive</strong> momentum.</li>
          <li>The car moving left in the same diagram would have <strong>negative</strong> momentum.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>4) Conservation of Momentum – The Principle</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>The <strong>principle of conservation of momentum</strong> says that in a <strong>closed system</strong>, the total momentum before an event is <strong>equal</strong> to the total momentum after the event.</li>
          <li>This applies to events like <strong>collisions</strong> and <strong>explosions</strong>.</li>
          <li>Mathematically: <strong>total momentum before = total momentum after</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>5) Head-On Collision Example – Dinosaur and Car</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Imagine the dinosaur and the car moving <strong>towards each other</strong> and then colliding.</li>
          <li>We treat them as two particles that stick together and move with a <strong>shared velocity</strong> after the collision.</li>
          <li>Step 1: Find total momentum before collision by <strong>adding their momenta with signs</strong>.</li>
          <li>Using right as positive: dinosaur has +54,000 kg m/s; car has −30,000 kg m/s.</li>
          <li>Total momentum before = +54,000 + (−30,000) = <strong>+24,000 kg m/s</strong>.</li>
          <li>By conservation of momentum, total momentum after the collision is also <strong>+24,000 kg m/s</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>6) Finding the Shared Velocity After Collision</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>After they collide and stick together, we treat dinosaur + car as <strong>one combined object</strong>.</li>
          <li>Combined mass = 4500 kg + 1200 kg = <strong>5700 kg</strong>.</li>
          <li>We rearrange p = m v to <strong>v = p / m</strong>.</li>
          <li>So v = 24,000 ÷ 5700 ≈ <strong>4.2–4.4 m/s to the right</strong> (depending on rounding).</li>
          <li>This means they both move off together <strong>to the right</strong> after the collision.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>7) Situations with Zero Initial Momentum – Recoil</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>If the total momentum before an event is <strong>zero</strong>, the total momentum after must also be <strong>zero</strong>.</li>
          <li>Stationary objects have <strong>zero momentum</strong> because their velocity is zero.</li>
          <li>Example: A gun before it is fired has <strong>zero momentum</strong>.</li>
          <li>When it fires, the bullet gains forward momentum, so the gun must gain <strong>backward momentum</strong> to keep the total at zero.</li>
          <li>This backwards motion of the gun is called <strong>recoil</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>8) Gun and Bullet Example – Working Out Recoil</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Suppose a gun of mass <strong>2.0 kg</strong> fires a <strong>5 g bullet</strong> (0.005 kg) forwards.</li>
          <li>The bullet&apos;s velocity is <strong>120 m/s</strong> forwards.</li>
          <li>Bullet momentum = 0.005 × 120 = <strong>0.6 kg m/s</strong> forwards.</li>
          <li>Let the gun&apos;s velocity be v (backwards). Its momentum is then <strong>2v</strong>.</li>
          <li>Total momentum after must be zero: 2v + 0.6 = 0.</li>
          <li>Rearrange: 2v = −0.6, so v = <strong>−0.3 m/s</strong>.</li>
          <li>The negative sign shows the gun recoils in the <strong>opposite direction</strong> to the bullet.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>9) Symbol for Momentum</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>The letter symbol used for momentum is <strong>p</strong> (often shown as the Greek letter rho, but it looks like p).</li>
          <li>The momentum equation can be written as <strong>p = m v</strong>.</li>
          <li>Always include a <strong>direction or sign</strong> when working with momentum in 1D problems.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>10) Problem-Solving Tips</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Choose one direction as <strong>positive</strong> at the start and stick to it.</li>
          <li>Assign <strong>positive and negative velocities</strong> according to that chosen direction.</li>
          <li>Use <strong>p = m v</strong> to find individual momenta, then add them to get the <strong>total</strong>.</li>
          <li>Apply <strong>conservation of momentum</strong> to link momentum before and after the event.</li>
          <li>Rearrange the equation to solve for the <strong>unknown velocity</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
