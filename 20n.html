    <h2>Key Notes (rewritten from the speech)</h2>

    <details open>
      <summary>What the National Grid is</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>The <b>National Grid</b> is a large network of <b>cables, pylons, and transformers</b> that distributes electricity across the country.</li>
        <li>It allows electricity generated in power stations to be transmitted efficiently to homes and businesses.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Where electricity comes from</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>In the UK, electricity is generated from several sources, but a large proportion is produced in <b>power stations</b>.</li>
        <li>Power stations (whether using <b>fossil fuels</b> or <b>nuclear fission</b>) typically generate <b>heat</b> first, then convert <b>thermal energy</b> into <b>electrical energy</b>.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Demand changes throughout the day</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Electricity generation depends on <b>demand</b>.</li>
        <li>Demand often peaks in the <b>late afternoon and evening</b> when people return home and use appliances (cooking, TVs, etc.).</li>
        <li>To handle demand surges, power stations keep <b>spare capacity</b> and may run below their maximum output.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Power, voltage, and current</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Electrical power depends on <b>voltage</b> and <b>current</b> (power = voltage × current).</li>
        <li>To transmit huge amounts of power across long distances, the grid must manage voltage and current carefully.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Why high current causes energy loss</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>If a <b>large current</b> flows through transmission wires, the wires heat up due to their <b>resistance</b>.</li>
        <li>This heating wastes energy to the surroundings, making long-distance transmission inefficient.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Why the grid uses very high voltage</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>To reduce energy loss, the grid keeps the <b>current low</b>.</li>
        <li>For the same power, lowering current means the <b>voltage must be increased</b>.</li>
        <li>So electricity leaving a power station is sent at a <b>very high voltage</b>.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Step-up transformers</summary>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Step-up transformers</b> increase the voltage before transmission.</li>
        <li>The voltage is stepped up to about <b>400,000 V</b> for efficient long-distance transfer.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Transmission and pylons</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>High-voltage electricity is carried over long distances along overhead lines on large <b>pylons</b>.</li>
        <li>This connects regions across the country so electricity can be delivered where it is needed.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Step-down transformers and safety</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Near towns and homes, <b>step-down transformers</b> reduce the voltage.</li>
        <li>The voltage is lowered to around <b>230 V</b> for domestic use.</li>
        <li>Lowering voltage is essential because <b>high voltages are dangerous</b> and would <b>damage household appliances</b>.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Overall summary</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Electricity is generated in power stations, stepped up to high voltage, transmitted across the country, then stepped down to a safe voltage for homes.</li>
        <li>The National Grid’s main purpose is to <b>reduce energy loss</b> during transmission while delivering electricity safely.</li>
      </ul>
