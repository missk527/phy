        <h2>Key Notes (rewritten from the speech)</h2>

    <details open>
      <summary>What refraction is</summary>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Refraction</b> happens when a light wave changes direction as it passes from one <b>medium</b> to another (for example, from <b>air</b> into <b>glass</b>).</li>
        <li>The direction only changes if the ray hits the boundary at an <b>angle</b>. If it enters <b>perpendicular</b> to the surface, it continues straight.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Why light bends: speed changes in different materials</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Waves travel at different <b>speeds</b> in different materials because materials have different <b>densities</b>.</li>
        <li>For light (an electromagnetic wave), a <b>more optically dense</b> material makes the wave travel <b>slower</b>.</li>
        <li>So when light goes from a less dense medium to a more dense medium (air → glass), it <b>slows down</b>.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Bending towards or away from the normal</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>The <b>normal</b> is an imaginary line drawn <b>perpendicular</b> to the surface at the point where the ray hits.</li>
        <li>Entering a <b>more dense</b> medium (air → glass): the ray bends <b>towards the normal</b>.</li>
        <li>Entering a <b>less dense</b> medium (glass → air): the ray bends <b>away from the normal</b>.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>How to draw a refraction ray diagram through a glass block</summary>
      <ol>
        <li>Draw the <b>incident ray</b> and mark the <b>point of incidence</b> where it hits the surface.</li>
        <li>Draw the <b>normal</b> at 90° to the surface at that point.</li>
        <li>Inside the glass, draw the <b>refracted ray</b> bending <b>towards the normal</b> (because the light slows down in glass).</li>
        <li>Continue the refracted ray to the far side of the glass.</li>
        <li>At the second surface, draw another <b>normal</b>.</li>
        <li>Draw the <b>emergent ray</b> bending <b>away from the normal</b> as it leaves the glass into air.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="small"><b>Tip:</b> In exams, the exact bend is usually not judged precisely—what matters is the <i>correct direction</i> (towards/away from the normal).</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Angles to label</summary>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Angle of incidence (i)</b>: between the incident ray and the normal.</li>
        <li><b>Angle of refraction (r)</b>: between the refracted ray and the normal (in the second medium).</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Frequency vs wavelength when speed changes</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Wave speed depends on frequency and wavelength: <b>v = f × λ</b>.</li>
        <li>When light enters a new medium, its <b>frequency stays the same</b>.</li>
        <li>So a change in speed means the <b>wavelength changes</b>:
          <ul>
            <li>If speed <b>decreases</b>, wavelength <b>decreases</b>.</li>
            <li>If speed <b>increases</b>, wavelength <b>increases</b>.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Triangular prisms and dispersion</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Different <b>wavelengths</b> of visible light refract by different amounts.</li>
        <li>White light contains many wavelengths, so in a <b>triangular prism</b> each colour bends a bit differently.</li>
        <li>This spreads the light into a <b>spectrum</b> (a rainbow effect), called <b>dispersion</b>.</li>
      </ul>
