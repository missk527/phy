      <h2>Notes (Key points from the speech)</h2>

      <details open>
        <summary>Radio waves in the electromagnetic spectrum</summary>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Radio waves</strong> are part of the <strong>electromagnetic spectrum</strong>.</li>
          <li>They have the <strong>longest wavelength</strong> and the <strong>lowest frequency</strong> of all electromagnetic waves.</li>
          <li>Electromagnetic waves are made of oscillating <strong>electric</strong> and <strong>magnetic</strong> fields.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Generating radio waves (transmitter + alternating current)</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Radio waves can be generated using an <strong>alternating current (AC)</strong>, because AC contains <strong>oscillating charges</strong>.</li>
          <li>A <strong>transmitter</strong> produces the radio wave and is often connected to an <strong>oscilloscope</strong>.</li>
          <li>The oscilloscope shows the <strong>frequency</strong> of the AC used.</li>
          <li><strong>Key idea:</strong> the frequency of the AC determines the frequency of the radio wave produced.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Detecting radio waves (receiver)</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>A <strong>receiver</strong> detects the radio wave by absorbing its energy.</li>
          <li>The receiver generates a new <strong>alternating current</strong>, which can also be displayed on an oscilloscope.</li>
          <li><strong>Key idea:</strong> the AC produced in the receiver has the <strong>same frequency</strong> as the transmitted wave.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>How information is carried</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Because the receiver reproduces the transmitted frequency, we can use frequency to <strong>transfer information</strong>.</li>
          <li>Example: transmitting a wave at <strong>800 Hz</strong> could represent the number <strong>800</strong>.</li>
          <li>This principle can be used to communicate many kinds of information, not just numbers.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Three types used for communication</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>The main use of radio waves is <strong>communication</strong>.</li>
          <li>Three types to know: <strong>longwave</strong>, <strong>shortwave</strong>, and <strong>very shortwave</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Longwave</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Can travel <strong>very large distances</strong> (e.g., London to Singapore).</li>
          <li>They <strong>diffract</strong> (bend) around the <strong>curved surface of the Earth</strong>.</li>
          <li>Good for <strong>long-range communication</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Shortwave</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Can also travel long distances, but they do <strong>not</strong> curve around the Earth.</li>
          <li>Instead, they are <strong>reflected</strong> by the <strong>ionosphere</strong> (an electrically charged layer in the upper atmosphere).</li>
          <li>By bouncing between the ionosphere and Earth, they can cover long distances.</li>
          <li>The speech also mentions short-range data transmission such as <strong>Bluetooth</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Very shortwave</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Used for <strong>TV</strong> and <strong>FM radio</strong>.</li>
          <li>They require <strong>line-of-sight</strong>: travelling directly from transmitter to receiver.</li>
          <li>Signals can be blocked by obstacles like <strong>hills</strong> and <strong>tunnels</strong> (e.g., in a car).</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Take-home message</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Radio waves are generated by AC in a transmitter and detected by a receiver producing AC of the same frequency.</li>
          <li>Different radio-wave types travel in different ways, which affects how they are used for communication.</li>
        </ul>
