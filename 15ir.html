      <h2>Key Notes (English)</h2>
      <p class="muted">Adapted from the provided speech. Focus: the equation V = IR, how to use it, and how to interpret current–potential difference (I–V) graphs for resistors, filament lamps and diodes.</p>

      <details open>
        <summary>1) The Equation V = IR (Ohm’s Law Form)</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>The equation <strong>V = IR</strong> links three key electrical quantities.</li>
          <li><strong>V</strong> = potential difference (voltage), measured in <strong>volts (V)</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>I</strong> = current, measured in <strong>amperes (A)</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>R</strong> = resistance, measured in <strong>ohms (Ω)</strong>.</li>
          <li>In words, it means: <strong>voltage = current × resistance</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>2) Using V = IR – Basic Calculations</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>If we know any two of V, I and R, we can calculate the third.</li>
          <li>Example 1: A circuit has a current of <strong>4 A</strong> and a resistance of <strong>2 Ω</strong>.</li>
          <li>Using V = IR, the potential difference is V = 4 × 2 = <strong>8 V</strong>.</li>
          <li>Example 2: A <strong>24 V</strong> battery produces a current of <strong>8 A</strong>.</li>
          <li>To find resistance, rearrange to <strong>R = V / I</strong> and calculate R = 24 / 8 = <strong>3 Ω</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>3) Rearranging the Equation</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>From <strong>V = IR</strong> we can rearrange to find different quantities:</li>
          <li>To find current: <strong>I = V / R</strong>.</li>
          <li>To find resistance: <strong>R = V / I</strong>.</li>
          <li>These forms are essential when solving circuit problems.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>4) Proportional Relationship Between V and I</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>As long as the <strong>resistance stays constant</strong>, voltage and current are <strong>directly proportional</strong>.</li>
          <li>If potential difference increases, the current increases by the <strong>same factor</strong>, and vice versa.</li>
          <li>This relationship can be shown on a graph of <strong>current (I)</strong> against <strong>potential difference (V)</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>5) I–V Graphs for Ohmic Conductors (Wires and Resistors)</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>An <strong>ohmic conductor</strong> is a component whose resistance stays constant as long as conditions (like temperature) stay the same.</li>
          <li>Examples include simple <strong>metal wires</strong> and <strong>fixed resistors</strong> at constant temperature.</li>
          <li>Their I–V graphs are <strong>straight lines through the origin</strong>.</li>
          <li>The straight line shows that <strong>current is proportional to potential difference</strong>.</li>
          <li>The <strong>negative part</strong> of the line (below the axis) represents the same behaviour when the battery is connected the other way round, so V and I are negative.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>6) Gradient and Resistance</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>On an I–V graph, the <strong>steepness (gradient)</strong> tells us about the resistance.</li>
          <li>A <strong>steeper line</strong> means a <strong>larger current</strong> for the same voltage and therefore a <strong>smaller resistance</strong>.</li>
          <li>A <strong>less steep line</strong> means <strong>smaller current</strong> for the same voltage and therefore a <strong>larger resistance</strong>.</li>
          <li>For example, a <strong>10 Ω resistor</strong> would have a line that is <strong>less steep</strong> than a smaller resistor.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>7) Effect of Temperature on Resistance</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>When we draw straight I–V graphs for wires and resistors, we assume the <strong>temperature is constant</strong>.</li>
          <li>If the temperature increases, the <strong>resistance also increases</strong>.</li>
          <li>In real circuits, high currents can cause wires to <strong>heat up over time</strong>.</li>
          <li>Because of this heating, the I–V line may not stay perfectly straight in practice.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>8) Filament Lamp I–V Graph</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>A filament lamp is a light bulb containing a very thin <strong>metal filament</strong>.</li>
          <li>As current flows through the filament, it heats up until it is <strong>hot enough to emit light</strong>.</li>
          <li>The high temperature causes the <strong>resistance to increase</strong> a lot.</li>
          <li>On an I–V graph, the curve is <strong>steep at low voltages</strong> but becomes <strong>less steep</strong> as voltage and current increase.</li>
          <li>This shows that <strong>less current flows per volt</strong> at higher voltages because the filament is hotter and more resistive.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>9) Diode I–V Graph</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>A <strong>diode</strong> is a component that allows current to flow in <strong>only one direction</strong>.</li>
          <li>When the potential difference is in the <strong>forward direction</strong> (positive), the diode allows current to flow once a certain voltage is reached.</li>
          <li>In the <strong>reverse direction</strong>, the diode has a very <strong>high resistance</strong>.</li>
          <li>Because of this, almost <strong>no current flows</strong> when the potential difference is negative.</li>
          <li>On the I–V graph, we see current only on the <strong>positive side</strong> of the voltage axis.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>10) Summary of Key Ideas</summary>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>V = IR</strong> links voltage, current and resistance and allows us to calculate any one if we know the other two.</li>
          <li>For a constant resistance, the I–V graph is a <strong>straight line</strong> showing direct proportionality.</li>
          <li>Higher resistance means a <strong>less steep</strong> I–V line.</li>
          <li><strong>Filament lamps</strong> heat up, so their resistance increases and their I–V graph is a <strong>curved line</strong> that flattens.</li>
          <li><strong>Diodes</strong> conduct mainly in <strong>one direction</strong>, giving an I–V graph with current on the positive side only.</li>
        </ul>
